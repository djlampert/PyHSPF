"""
PyHSPF contains a library of subroutines to run the Hydrological
Simulation Program in Fortran (HSPF), Python extensions to the HSPF
library, and a series of classes for building HSPF input files,
performing simulations, and postprocessing simulation results.

HSPF requires flowline and catchment data for a stream network, land use
data for the stream reach subbasins, time series of climate and hydrology
data. A series of preprocessing classes were developed to extract data
from the following publically-available databases on the World Wide Web:

- National Hydrography Dataset Plus Version 2 (NHDPlus)
- National Water Information System (NWIS)
- National Inventory of Dams (NID)
- Cropland Data Layer (CDL)
- National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB)
- Global Historical Climate Network Daily (GHCND)
- Global Summary of the Day (GSOD)
- Hourly Precipitation Database (DSI-3240)

The "core" module requires NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, and can be used to
generate the HSPF input files. The preprocessing routines require GDAL,
PyShp, and Pillow.

PyHSPF can be used to assimilate the data into an HSPF model, build the
HSPF input files, simulate the model over a period of time, and then
provide statistics and plots of the simulation output. A series
of examples is provided to illustrate PyHSPF usage.
